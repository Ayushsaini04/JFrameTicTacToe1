# JFrameTicTacToe1
The Tic Tac Toe Game is a Java application offering a classic gaming experience. 
With a user-friendly interface, players interact by clicking grid cells to place X's and O's. The game dynamically switches turns, detecting wins through horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines, and identifies draws when the board is filled. Users can reset the game for a fresh start.

Visually, the game features clear grid lines and contrasting symbols for readability. Its responsive design ensures adaptability across various screen sizes. Simple controls make it accessible to players of all ages and skill levels. The project emphasizes scalability, allowing for future enhancements like additional features or multiplayer functionality.
